First run node0.cpp in node0 directory.
IP and PORT of root node(node 0) are well known to other nodes.
To add new nodes, run node.cpp in other folders.

node1 and node2 have hardcoded port values. 
node3 has general which can be added to topology after giving port as input.  

We can change values of root node ip,port or hash function's MOD by changing #define values.

We have used m=3, MOD = (2^3) = 8.
