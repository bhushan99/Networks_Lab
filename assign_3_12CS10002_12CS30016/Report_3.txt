As traffic generation rate increases,

1) 	Throughput (Average amount of data bits successfully transmitted per unit time) increases 
	since more data is transmitted through channel per unit time.

2)	Forwarding Delay increases since number of collisions increase as traffic increases, after collision occurs,
	involved nodes have to send packet again which increases delay.

3)	Jitter variation cannot be predicted.
